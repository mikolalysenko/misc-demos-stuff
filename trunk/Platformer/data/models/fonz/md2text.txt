Other info              :  As you can tell I borrowed a large percentage of my skins from other quake2 skins, 
                                 and quake1.  I wanted this model to Fit into the q2 universe, so I cut off body parts.
I am no skinner, and the couple I made are just meant mostly as an example to real    
skinners.
